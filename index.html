            I was born in LA and have lived here my entire life. I temporarily moved to the Univerity of California, Riverside for a year to get my degree in Political Science and a minor in History. But thereafter I came back to LA and I'm very glad to call this place "home sweet home"! I currently reside in the community/area of Florence-Graham to be more precise.

          <!-- I mentioned two interests: my love for art and video games -->
          <p>
            I still recall moments in middle school where we had some lessons in HTML. Like my two other brothers (sorry, but not my sister) I was proud to be talented in art. So being able to fiddle around with code to decorate and organize my HTML page was an experience that I never thought I would find satisfying! I took some introductory computer science classes in my time at UCR. I enjoyed the vast majority of it since it rekindled my knowledge throughout the years. Additionally, I really love video games. When I built my pc I was finally able to mess around with the code files here and there, allowing me to alter/mod certain aspects of games. I am excited to learn more about coding and to delve into many partnerships with other fellow programmers!
